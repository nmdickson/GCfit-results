# Results of the fits of MW globular clusters using GCfit

- `clusters/`
  + `NGC*/`
    * Parameter posteriors, marginal distributions, black hole probability distributions, kinematic profiles, cumulative mass profiles and mass function confidence intervals, for each cluster
    * Core collapsed clusters are also shown without BHs under `no_BHs/`

- `parameters/`
  + Summary (machine-readable) table of all best-fitting parameters with statistical uncertainties
  + All figures represent final sample of clusters used in paperI, including ω-cen and fixed core-collapsed clusters. See the papers (or `paper_figures/`) for cleaner plots.
  + `comparisons/`
    * Distance, remnant fraction, mass, half-mass radius and BH mass comparisons with various literature values
  + `distributions/`
    * Violin plots of distributions of all parameters, for all clusters
  + `relations/`
    * Relationships between all parameters, and all parameters with dynamical age, remaining mass fraction, and orbital parameters

- `thesis_figures/`
  + All figures from the MSc thesis corresponding to this work
  + These are most likely out of date, but shown here for posterity

- `paperI_figures/`
  + All figures from paperI (Multimass modelling of Milky Way globular clusters I. Implications on their stellar initial mass function above 1 Msun)
